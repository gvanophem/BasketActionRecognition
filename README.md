Code for my Action Recognition Models

In this folder, you'll find all the code used to create, train and test my models, as well as to pre-process the data. However, as this repository must be public, I can't include the data relating to my problem, as these are the property of SportRadar and can't be distributed online.

All the required dependencies are available in requirements.txt
